# Advent of Code 2020 - My Solutions

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual Advent calendar of very engaging programming puzzles. The puzzles can be solved in any programming language and the website provides public and (optionally) private leaderboards to keep the game entertaining (although it is very much entertaining without it as well).

Each day from 1st Dec to 25th Dec the Advent releases a new set of two challenges. Solving each one gives you a star, making up to maximum 2 per day, and a maximum of 50 each year.

I'm solving these problems in python, and you will find all results in python scripts in each day's folder.
